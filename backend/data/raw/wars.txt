The Owu Kingdom was destroyed in the early 19th century (approx. 1821-1825) during the Owu Wars.
This war was a major catalyst for the Yoruba civil wars that followed.
The combined forces of Ife and Ijebu laid siege to Owu-Ipole for five years before it fell.
Following the destruction, the Owu people were dispersed across Yorubaland.
Many Owu refugees settled in Abeokuta, where they established the Owu quarter.
