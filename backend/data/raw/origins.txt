The Owu people are a subgroup of the Yoruba people of West Africa.
Owu history begins with their first settlement (Owu-Ipole) in the 14th century.
According to oral tradition, the first Olowu (King of Owu) was a prince of the Ife kingdom, son of Oduduwa's daughter.
The crown of Owu is said to have been brought from Ile-Ife by the first King, Pawu.
They are known for their strong warrior tradition and were the first Yoruba kingdom to organize a standing army.
